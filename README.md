**Steps Followed:**
1. Installed and launched ProtonVPN.
2. Connected to a free server (Japan-FREE#28).
3. Verified changed IP using whatismyipaddress.com (see screenshot).
4. Visited websites to ensure encrypted traffic.
5. Disconnected and checked IP again for comparison.

## ✅ VPN Benefits
- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts traffic and secures browsing
- Protects identity over public Wi-Fi

## ⚠️ VPN Limitations
- Slower internet speed on free servers
- Doesn’t guarantee full anonymity
- Some websites block VPN traffic

## 🔍 Browser Extension Check
- Checked installed extensions in browser settings.
- No suspicious or unknown extensions found.
- If found, I would have removed them and added screenshots.
